## Gradient Clustering
The (F)OPTICS algorithm does not explicitly assign objects to clusters, but instead
provides an augmented ordering which can be plotted in a reachability diagram. This algorithm can be used to extract the clusters from this augmented ordering or reachability diagram, based on the gradients of the vectors.


### How to run

There are three separate functions in this library:

* `gradient_extraction(clusterordering, minpts, t, w)`, where *clusterordering* is a list of ClusterObjects as defined in the the code, *minpts* the minimum number of points required for a set to be considered a cluster (as in (F)OPTICS), *t* the angle between two adjacent vectors and *w* the width by which each object is separated in the ordering. The function returns a list of clusters where the individual items are represented as ClusterObjects.
* `large_cluster_filtering(clusters, input_size, cluster_ratio)`, where *clusters* is the output from gradient_extraction, *input_size* the total number of items that are clustered and *cluster_ratio* the maximum ratio of the cluster size w.r.t. the total data set size.
* `merge_clusters(clusters, similarity_ratio)`, where *clusters* is the output of gradient_extraction or large_cluster_filtering and *similarity_ratio* the minimum size of the intersection between two clusters in terms of the largest of the two in order for the two clusters to be merged together.
